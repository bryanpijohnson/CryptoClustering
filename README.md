## Within the repo link, you will find the following folders and files to be reviewed and graded:

- **README.md** - that is this file :)
- **Crypto_Clustering.ipynb** - this is the Jupyter Notebook that should be run for the analysis
- **Resources** - this folder holds the initial CSV file that was used in the analysis

## Initial Set Up and Completion

I was able to quickly get through this assignment as it followed very closely to most of the examples that we had done in class. Having that repetition was actually very beneficial in helping me understand the content.

## Issues

The only issue I felt I had was at the end in the composite graphs of the scaled scatter plot vs. the PCA scatter plot. When I composed them, the colorings didn't match from the original graphs and the legend didn't match either. Instead, I opted to put the graphs next to each other. In this case, the coloring stayed the same so that it was easy to tell which groups the points belonged to in each graph.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
